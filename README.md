# DonnaSpecter

Welcome to the world of DonnaSpecter, an open-source software (OSS) project that's as sharp, adaptable, and indispensable as Donna Paulson herself. As a tribute to the legendary secretary from the TV show "Suits", this AI-powered personal assistant is ready to handle your daily tasks with the same flair and proficiency.

## Features

### Email Handling

Just as Donna manages the communications for Pearson Hardman, the `email_handler` module takes charge of your incoming and outgoing emails, ensuring not a single important message slips through the cracks.

### Task Scheduling

Ever wonder how Donna keeps track of all those appointments and meetings? With the `scheduler` module, DonnaSpecter has an impeccable sense of timing, ensuring you never miss a task or deadline.

### AI Modeling

Donna always seems to know exactly what's needed, doesn't she? The `ai_model` directory houses the intelligence behind DonnaSpecter, enabling her to anticipate your needs and offer solutions.

### Frontend and Backend

Every law firm needs its front-of-house and its backroom experts. The `frontend` and `backend` directories contain the code that keeps DonnaSpecter running smoothly, from the interface you see to the data processing happening behind the scenes.

### Security

In the world of legal drama, confidentiality is paramount. Our `security` module is designed to protect your data with as much diligence as Donna protects the secrets of Pearson Hardman.

### Database Management

Every case detail, every clause, every precedent - Donna remembers them all. The `database` module is the digital equivalent, storing and managing your data with precision.

### Microservices Architecture

Just as a law firm relies on the expertise of various departments, DonnaSpecter is built on a microservices architecture for scalable, reliable, and independent deployment of services.

### DevOps

Pearson Hardman wouldn't be a top law firm without its streamlined processes. The `cicd`, `kubernetes`, and `docker` directories reflect our commitment to efficiency and modern development practices.

So if you encounter any obstacles in your journey with DonnaSpecter, don't hesitate to reach out and report any issues. We're in this together, and we'll break down those walls as a team. Don't be afraid to dive in and learn as you go. In the immortal words of Harvey Specter and I am sure McKay would agree, "the only time success comes before work is in the dictionary." DonnaSpecter is here to make your work more manageable. "Remember, the road to success is still yours to travel and it is measured by how many lines of code you write" - McKay Wrigley, somewhere, so you definitely needed this to help you catch up.

This guide assumes that the user has basic knowledge of how to use a terminal and has Python installed on their computer. If this isn't the case, they may need to look up some additional resources to get started.
